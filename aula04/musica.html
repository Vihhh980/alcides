        Ooh
I

I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Woo-ooh

Ooh, lost
Lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh-oh

If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

Ooh, ooh
I'd wanna be next to you

        <h5>Ordinary</h5>
        <p>
        They say the holy water's watered down
And this town's lost its faith
Our colors will fade eventually
So if our time is running out day after day
We'll make the mundane our masterpiece

Oh my, my
Oh my, my love
I take one look at you

You're taking me out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down
Till we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
Something so out of the ordinary
You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary
Shatter me with your touch
Oh, Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found

Hopeless hallelujah
Oh, this side of Heaven's gate
Oh, my life, how do ya
Breathe and take my breath away?

At your altar, I will pray
You're the sculptor, I'm the clay
Oh my, my

You're taking me out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down
Till we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
Something so out (out) of the ordinary (ordinary)
You got me kissing the ground (ground) of your sanctuary (sanctuary)
Shatter me with your touch
Oh, Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found

Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy
Whenever you're next to me, oh my, my
World was in black and white until I saw your light
I thought you had to die to find

Something so out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down
Till we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
Something so out (out) of the ordinary
You got me kissing the ground (ground) of your sanctuary (sanctuary)
Shatter me with your touch
Oh, Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
